Until the middle of the 19th century, people believed that all living creatures on the planet -including humans- were created by a divine force, such as God.

**Charles Darwin (1809-1882)**

Although, some researchers were already talking about an evolution of the species, #Darwin was the first British naturalist to propose (**to come up**) with an explanation for evolution supported by evidence. **(how evolution might occur through natural selection)**.

To achieve this, he had to make an extraordinary journey, conduct hundreds of experiments, and spend 20 years refining his ideas.

In 1831, #Darwin was 22 years old and he was studying at University when he was invited to join an expedition. SO, he boarded the *Beagle* and spent almost (nearly) 5 years traveling across different continents, starting in South America.

He returned with numerous specimens and fossil samples collected during his journey. This fossils led him to consider the possibility of evolution.

Then, he went to the Galápagos Islands, where he observed giant tortoises with different characteristics depending on the habitat they lived in. For example, in areas with dense vegetation and high humidity, the turtles had a short neck and a dome-shape shell, while in areas of the island with drier environment, turtles had long necks and differently shaped shells adapted to that environment. 

After coming back, he spent time observing how breeders crossed different species of animals to produce selected species (selected traits). So, he thought that, just as humans could select traits artificially, perhaps nature could do the same.

However, he can't explain how it happens until he reads a work by **Thomas Robert Malthus** in which expresses concerns that food would not be enough to support with the rapidly growing population of Europe over time so, that could lead to a struggle for survival. This idea led Darwin to think about how evolution works, he thought that it is not the strongest species that survives instead, it is the one that best adapts to the environment in which it lives.

The species that are most successful at reproducing pass their traits on to their lineage and over time, this new variations can eventually end up becoming in a new specie.

Because of this, there were differences between the turtles on the Galapagos Islands, where turtles with longer neck could more easily reach bushes in drier environments, while turtles with shorter necks, which lived in more humid environments, could feed on grass and protects themselves from predators thanks to their shorter necks and dome-shape shelves.

Darwin said that the same thing happens with humans, we are the product of common ancestor, just like all the living beings, and thanks to evolution, life on the planet become so (incredibly) diverse.

After his trip, he began to write many papers based on his findings, but he didn't publish anything until he was certain about his conclusions. That changed when **Alfred Russel Wallace** sent him a letter, explaining that he had come to the same conclusion about that evolution occurred by natural selection. So, Darwin feared that Wallace would keep all the credit so, they decided to publish a joint letter explaining their findings.
But a year later, Darwin published The Origin of Species, for which he became a celebrated figure.

**We know that evolution is a fact. The planet keeps changing, sometimes dramatically and we, keep changing with it**
