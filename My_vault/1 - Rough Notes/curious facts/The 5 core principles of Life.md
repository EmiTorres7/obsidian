Until the middle of the 19th century, people believed that all living creatures on the planet -including humans- were created by a divine force, such as God.

Charles Darwin (1809-1882)

Although, some researchers were already talking about an evolution of the species, #Darwin was the first British naturalist to propose (**to come up**) with an explanation for evolution supported by evidence. **(how evolution might occur through natural selection)**.

To achieve this, he had to make an extraordinary journey, conduct hundreds of experiments, and spend 20 years refining his ideas.

In 1831, #Darwin was 22 years old and he was studying at University when he was invited to join an expedition. SO, he boarded the *Beagle* and spent almost (nearly) 5 years traveling across different continents, starting in South America.

He returned with numerous specimens and fossil samples collected during his journey. This fossils led him to consider the possibility of evolution.

Then, he went to the Gal√°pagos Islands, where he observed giant tortoises with different characteristics depending on the habitat they lived in. For example, in areas with dense vegetation and high humidity, the turtles had a short neck and a dome-shape shell, while in areas of the island with drier environment, turtles had long necks and differently shaped shells adapted to that environment. 

After coming back, he spent time observing how breeders crossed different species of animals to produce selected species (selected traits). So, he thought that, just as humans could select traits artificially, perhaps nature could do the same.
