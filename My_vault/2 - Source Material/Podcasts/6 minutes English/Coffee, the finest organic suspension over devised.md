It's interesting to realize how much my taste for coffee has changed/evolved
I started getting more into drinking coffee during University, maybe around my second year.

In fact, before that I hated the smell and taste of coffee. I can't believe that now I love the smell and really enjoy drinking a cup of coffee.
Mostly, I started to taste it because my partner drinks a lot, and I wanted to share his love for coffee or to love it as much as he did, or to be invited out for a cup of coffee.

Whatever the reason is (for whatever reason), little by little, I got more into coffee and now I can't go without it for more two or three days (I can't stand being without it for more than a couple of days)

A few days ago, I listened to a podcast about coffee, and I was stunned by how elaborate, complex, and long the coffee production process is, while for many of us, all it takes is short walk and quick pour
(It blow my mind how complex and lengthy the coffee-making process is, even though for us it usually just means walking to the kitchen and pouring a cup)

Behind the action, there's a whole dedicated process involved in the making of this incredible and amazing drink.
I learned something about it from the video I watched. This amazing process begins in a place called Pitalito, located in Colombia.
The family farms cultivate these shrub, this kind of plants were  first domesticated in Ethiopia, each shrub is filled with small berries called "coffee cherries".

They pick them up and each farm have its own method for processing the fruit, the workers deliver their picked cherries to the wet mill.
This machine separates the seed from the fruit and sort them by density. The seeds sink to the bottom of the mill where they ferment in a tub of water for 1 o 2 days.
Then, the workers put the seeds out to dry after remove the fruit, the seeds are separate on large grids.

During the next 3 weeks, they rake the seeds regularly to ensure they dry. 
Once the coffee beans are dry, a truck takes the grains to a place with different machines like mills that resorts the seeds by density, sizes and, an optical scanner sorts by color.
Then, professionals select grains based on roast and prepare in a process where they evaluated the coffee's taste, aroma and the other characteristic to determine its quality. 

Then, grains are compacted and transported by ships from the port to around the world. A truck transport the grains to a warehouse and then to a roaster where a machine makes a roasting cycle, this is controlled and regulated by an engineer. 
This process releases oil within the seed making the grains grind-able and brew-able with a brown color and rich aroma.

Then, workers packs the grains and deliver to a different stores across the city. Each coffee company have a person who carefully selects beans and logistic team manage bean delivery routs and finally, baristas serve this coffee.

>So, let's make sure we don't value the final product more than the people who make it.
