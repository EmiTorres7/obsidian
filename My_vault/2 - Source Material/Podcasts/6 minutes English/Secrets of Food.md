Eating fresh fruits is good for us.

In the program, they (discuss) introduce the topic of whether it's true that eating an apple a day really has health benefits for us 
It's well known from scientific research that eating an apple a day is good for our health because they are a nutritious snack. especially the skin of the apple, as it is full of fiber, vitamins, and particularly flavonoids. These are chemical compounds that help reduce blood pressure and improve brain and heart health, plus it helps maintain a healthy body weight.

Another advantage of this fruit is that there are many ways to eat it. 
(One of the great things about this fruit is that it can be eaten in many different ways, I love their versatility, it is amazing how we can enjoy eating apples in many forms).
You can eat apples in porridge, sliced with yogurt (which is my favorite way to eat them), in desserts, and even baked in the oven.

In addition, I found it interesting to know that they mentioned that cooking or baking apples does not destroy those healthy flavonoids, that means it does not significantly reduce the amount of healthy flavonoids they contain.

So, for all these reasons, apples are a great option if you want a snack, they are delicious and very nutritious choice.
